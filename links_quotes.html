                Links are written with the &lt;a&gt; containing the attribute href, defining the adress of the page you 
                want to link to.

                Block quotes can be written in blockquote tags. 
            </p>                  

            <p>This illustrates a block quote from another website, 
                https://www.quackit.com/html/tags/html_blockquote_tag.cfm:</p>

                <blockquote>The HTML &lt;blockquote&gt; tag is used for creating the 'blockquote' element. This element represents content that is quoted from another source.

                        Browsers usually render &lt;blockquote&gt; text as indented text. 
                        This results in an indented paragraph (or multiple indented paragraphs 
                        if the &lt;blockquote&gt; spans multiple paragraphs). For shorter quoted text 
                        that needs to display within a non-quoted paragraph, use &lt;q&gt; tag. 
                            Most browsers surround &lt;q&gt; text with quotation marks.
                        
                        Syntax
                        The &lt;blockquote&gt; tag is written as &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
                        with the quoted content inserted between the start and end tag.
                        Like this:                        
                        &lt;blockquote&gt;Quoted text here...&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
