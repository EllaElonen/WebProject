       <h1 style=color:chartreuse>Links</h1>
            <p>
                Links are written with the &lt;a&gt; containing the attribute href, defining the adress of the page you 
                want to link to.
            </p>

            <p>Absolute links are full web addresses, including www..., whereas relative links specify a file that has a relation to the page where the link is located. </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is an absolute link to w3schools that contains more information on links, 
                quotes and other important concepts in web development.>
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <a 
                    href="headings_paragraphs.html">Click Me
                </a>
            </p>

            <h1 style=color:cadetblue>Quotes</h1>

            <p> 
                Block quotes can be written in blockquote tags. 
            </p>                  

            <p>This illustrates a block quote from another website, 
                https://www.quackit.com/html/tags/html_blockquote_tag.cfm:</p>

            <blockquote>The HTML &lt;blockquote&gt; tag is used for creating the 'blockquote' element. This element represents content that is quoted from another source.

                Browsers usually render &lt;blockquote&gt; text as indented text. 
                This results in an indented paragraph (or multiple indented paragraphs 
                if the &lt;blockquote&gt; spans multiple paragraphs). For shorter quoted text 
                that needs to display within a non-quoted paragraph, use &lt;q&gt; tag. 
                    Most browsers surround &lt;q&gt; text with quotation marks.
                        
                Syntax
                The &lt;blockquote&gt; tag is written as &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
                with the quoted content inserted between the start and end tag.
                Like this:                        
                &lt;blockquote&gt;Quoted text here...&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
            </blockquote>
