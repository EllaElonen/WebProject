                Links are marked with the a-tag containing the attribute href=sourcelink.
            </p>

            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link to w3schools that contains more information on links.</a>

            <hr> 
            <p>The hr-tag here separates the head and body of the page. It appears as a separator line, 
                but itÂ´s primary purpose in HTML5 is to be a semantic separator of different kinds of content.

                Block quotes can be written in blockquote tags. 
            </p>                  

            <p>This illustrates a block quote from a website:</p>

                <blockquote cite="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quotation_elements.asp">
                    The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.

                            Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.
