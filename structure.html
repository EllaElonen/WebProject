    <p>The &lt;hr&gt; here separates the head and body of the page. It appears as a separator line, 
        but itÂ´s primary purpose in HTML5 is to be a semantic separator for different kinds of 
        content.

        <h1 style="font-size:60px; color: rgb(0, 255, 170);">The structure of an HTML page</h1>

        <p> 
            The sturucture of an HTML-page consists of a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;-which defines the markup language 
            so that the browser can display content correctly, and &gt;html&lt;-tags containing head and a body. The head contains 
            metainformation about the page, like encoding, author, description, keywords, title, software that was used to generate it, how search engines should treat it,
            how often the browser should refresh it, etc. 

            Here, for example, &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"&gt; was used to tell the page to 
            refresh every 30 seconds.
