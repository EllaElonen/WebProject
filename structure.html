        <p> 
            The sturucture of an HTML-page consists of a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;-tag that defines the language used,
            for example HTML5, and html&gt;&lt;-tags containing head and a body. The head contains 
            metainformation like author, title, encoding etc. 

            Here, &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"&gt; was used to tell the page to 
            refresh every 30 seconds. 
        </p>

        <hr> 
            <p>The hr-tag here separates the head and body of the page. It appears as a separator line, 
                but itÂ´s primary purpose in HTML5 is to be a semantic separator of different kinds of content. 
            </p>
