                <h1>The Structure of an HTML Page</h1>
            </div> 

            <div class=content>
			<p>
				When a browser loads a webpage, it creates a Document Object Model, DOM, of the page. You can use 
				JavaScript to change objects and their presentation styles in this structure. For example, you could replace 
				a paragraph, a picture or a table with another, or give it a background color as a response to a click from a user, for example. 
				So far, however, we are only concerned with the HTML-part. 
			</P>
            <p> 
                The basic structure of an HTML-page consists of a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;-which defines the markup language 
                so that the browser can display content correctly, and two &gt;html&lt;-tags, to tell the browser that the page is written 
				in HTML. containing head and a body. The head contains metainformation about the page, like encoding, 
				author, description, keywords, title, software that was used to generate it, how search engines should treat it,
                how often the browser should refresh it, etc. The head element can also contain links to JavaScript and CSS files
				needed to display that page.
            </p> 
        
            <p> 
                This page contains the following meta tags:
                author - the person who created it
                description - a description of the content
                generator - The software used to generate it. Here, the value is set to zero because no software was used. It could 
				also have been left out completely. 
                keywords - what the search engines should be looking for
                robots - defining desired behavior for search engines (set to NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW that tells robots 
				not to index or search the page for links).
            </p>

            <p>
                Regular paragraphs can be written inside the  &lt;p&gt; tag. 
            </p>
			<p>
                Here, for example, &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"&gt; was used to tell the page to 
                refresh every 30 seconds. 
            </p>
