					<h1>The Box Model of CSS: Margins, borders,padding and other useful properties.</h1>
				</header>
        
				<p class="box"> 
					CSS is based on a box model, illustrated by this paragraph. The element itself, including the empty space 
					around it it called padding, is lightgreen, and around it there is a solid springgreen border. Te margins are 
					the space around the element and its borders. The top and bottom margins are wider, which is why there is 
					more space between this paragraph and the heading, and this and next paragraph. Around the borders of the element there´s a double, seagreen 
					outline. The difference between margins and padding is that margins define the space inside the borders of an element, 
					padding the space outside. 
				</P>
	
				<header>
					<h2>Margins</h2>
				</header>
		
				<p class="margin"> 
					Margins define the space outside the borders of an element, which means outside the colored area,
					if you have added background-color to your element. This paragraph has a margin of 70em. 
				</P>
				<p class="margins"> 
					This paragraph defines each margin separately; margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px; margin-right: 150px;
					margin-left: 80px;.
				</P>
			</section>

					<h2>Borders</h2>
				</header>
		
				<p class="border-color">
					The border property has options to use border-color and other styles applied to the border. The border around 
					this paragraph has a solid style and a coral color applied to it. The style needs to be defined 
					before the color, otherwise te color has no effect. 
				</p>
	
				<p class="left">
					This paragraph has a border-left-color. 
				</p>
	
				<p class="right">
					This paragraph has a border-right-color. 
				</p>
	
				<p class="top">
					This paragraph has a order-top-color. 
				</p>
	
				<p class="bottom">
					This paragraph has a border-bottom-color. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="thin">
					The width of the borders can also be defined in it´s own property. This paragraph has a thin border-width.
				</p>
				
				<p class="thick">
					This paragraph has a thick border-width-bottom and 
					border-width-top, and a medium border-width-left and border-width-right.
				</p> 
				
				<p class="borderradius">
					Border-radius is the radius of the element's corners. This paragraph has a border-radius of 25px in all corners. Border-radius is defined for each corner clock-wise, 
					starting from top-left. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="borderradius2">
					This is another example with a border-radius 50px 20px.
				</p>
				
				<p class="shadow1">
					You can also add shadows around the borders of an element. This is one example of a paragraph with a shadow,
					specified with the box-shadow property. 
				</p>				
				
				<p class="shadow2">
					Box-shadow can also have a color.
				</p>

					<h2>Padding</h2>
				</header>
		
				<p class="padding"> 
					Padding is the space around the contents of an element, but still inside its borders (inside the colored area here). 
					For example, the headings on this page have a padding defined, 
					in order to make the colored area around it bigger, so the first letter does not start exactly at the border. 
					The padding of these headings is 20 px on the left (padding-left), and 10 px above and below (padding-top,padding-bottom).
					This paragraph has an increased padding, compared with other paragraphs (100 px). That shows up as 
					empty space inside the color frame. 
				</P>
				<p class="leftbottomtop">
					This paragraph has padding-left, padding-top, padding-bottom 120 and padding-right 0.
				</p>
				
				<p class="dotted">
					Elements can also have different outlines around them. This paragraph, for example, has a dotted outline, 
					and a solid border to illustrate the difference between border outline. The outline property also has 
					values dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset. 
				</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>				
				<h2 class="a">Visibility</h2>
				<h2 class="b">Heading with visibility hidden.</h2>
				
				<p>The above headings illustrate the property of visibility. The first one is set to visibility: visible. 
				What you do not see is another h2 "Heading with visibility: hidden". It still takes space 
				on the page, although you don´t see it.</p>

				<h2>RGBA and Opacity</h2>
			</header>
			
			<section>
				<p>
				The rbga function uses rgb colors and extends them with an alpha channel that specifies the opacity. 
				Following paragraphs use the rgba funktion, and illustrate how the background color of the body comes through
				the colors red, green, blue, grey, yellow and cerise (in that order) with different opacity values.

				<h2>Gradients</h2>
			</header>
			
			<section>
				<p class="gradient1">
					Linear gradient means a color change from one color at the top to another color at the bottom, that happens 
					in the direction of a straight line, like in this paragraph. In this paragraph, it changes from magenta to coral, 
					from top to bottom. You could also change the gradient direction, for example: 
				</p>
				
				<p class="gradient2">
					background-image: linear-gradient(to right, aqua, deeppink)
					Note: If you want to support some old browsers that don´t support gradient, add background-color before image, 
					for example the color you want to start from. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="gradient3">
					You can also add three or more colors:
					background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, darkgreen, lightgreen).
				</p>
				
				<p class="gradient4">
					This paragraph has the property background-image: linear-gradient(red, blue 10%, green 20%)
				</p>
				
				<p class="gradient5">
					This paragraph has the property background-image: linear-gradient(to top left, darkgreen, springgreen, lightgreen).
				</p>
				
				<p class="gradient6">
					This paragraph has the property background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(red, magenta 10%, pink 20%);
				</p>
				
				<p class="radgrad1">
					Radial gradient has a shape instead of a straight line.
					For a radius gradient you first need to define a size for the the element.(here: height: 150px; width: 200px;)
					This paragraph has the property background-image: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow, green);
				</p>
				
				<p class="radgrad2">
					This paragraph has the property height: 150px; width: 200px;
				</p>
				
				<p class="radgrad3">
					This paragraph has the property height: background-image: 
					radial-gradient(farthest-side at 60% 55%, lightblue, skyblue, aqua); It also defines the size of the gradient (from 
					the farthest side).
