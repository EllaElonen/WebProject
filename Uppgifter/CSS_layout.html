				<h2>Why HTML Tables are not optimal</h2>
		
				<p>
					Previously, before CSS existed, HTML tables were used for design purposes. For following reasons, 
					HTML tables are not optimal compared to CSS, and should be restricted to tables that are needed 
					for content purposes:
                    </p>
                
					<ul>
						<li>They use unnecessary bytes and time</li>
						<li>They can divide images and prevent copying of text</li>
						<li>Tables describe the presentation, not the contents, therefore they should be handled by CSS</li>
						<li>They are not easy to handle for screen readers and search engines</li>
						<li>They make redesign hard; CSS properties are easier to change</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>CSS Layout</h2>
		
				<p>
					Things you might have to consider in designing with CSS is screen resolution, browser, window size, hardware etc.
					CSS has three layout options: fixed, fluid and elastic. 
				</p>
				
				<h3>Fluid design</h3>
		
				<p>
					In fluid (liquid) layout, most components have 
					percentage widths, which means they adapt to the users screen. Some components might still have fixed widths. 
					This layout might be a bit hard to customize, and you may need to set min and max layouts. You can, 
					however, optimize the use of screen. This design is normally the most user-friendly, because it adapts 
					to the users conditions. With very large resolutions, it can create extra space, though. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="maxwidth">
					An important concept here is the max-width property of CSS. It decides the maximum width an element can get. 
					For example, paragraph lines are shortened in lack of space, like in this paragraph.
				</p>
				
				<p class="minwidth">
					The opposite of max-width is min-width, which is illustrated by this paragraph. Display: inline-block allows 
					you to set the width and height.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other things important to think about is to avoid using complicated graphics and hard techniques, that
					may make the page hard to maintain.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Fixed Width Design</h3>
		
				<p>
					Fixed width has the advantage that everybody will se the same width of things, they will not move or change size. 
					Some of the the cons are exessive white space, the need of horizontal scroll bars, and lower overall usability.
					When you build a page with fixed design, it is important to center your wrapper div (on this page, the article 
					tag is used because semantic tags are preferrable in HTML5). 
				</p>
				
				<h3>Elastic Width Design</h3>
				
				<p>
					Elastic Width design mixes the two previous ways of designing. It is many times preferred by designers. 
					It works by defining widths with em - a square of the font size. It adapts to the users text-size. It is
					hard to get it right, it can take a lot of skills and testing, and extra style-sheets might be needed.
					But if you think itÂ´s worth it, it may be more user-friendly at the end. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>Absolute and Relative Position</h2>
				
				 <p>
				 The position of an element can be set to absolute, so that the position of the element can be defined freely. 
				 For example, the heading "Heading" has a fixed position 100 px from the left edge of the page, and 150 from 
				 the top.
				 </p>
				
				<h3 class="absolute">Heading1</h3>
				
				<h3 class="absolute2">Heading2</h3>			

				<img src="images/Leaf.jpg" alt="FloatingLeaf">
				
				<h3>The Float Property</h3>	
				
				<p><img class="float" src="images/Magnolia.png" alt="Magnolia">
					This is a paragraph with an image illustrating the float property. Here it is set to float: left, which is why 
					the picture shows up on the left, with the text floating around it (The following element has the property clear: both
					in order to move it down so it does not float around this picture too.) 
				</p>
				
				<h3 class="clear">The column-count Property</h3>	 
				
				<p>
					If you want to make an article or other element look like a newspaper article, you could use the column-count 
					property. <a href="CSS_layout_column.html">Here</a> is an example: 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Here, you see examples of the three different layout designs:<br>
					<br>
					<a href="CSS_layout_fixed.html">Fixed</a> <br>
					<a href="CSS_layout_fluid.html">Fluid</a> <br>
					<a href="CSS_layout_elastic.html">Elastic</a> <br>
