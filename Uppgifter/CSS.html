					<h2>
						How to Add CSS to Your Webpage
					</h2>
                </header>
                
				<p>
					HTML provides a basic structure to a web page, consisting of elements like text, images, tables, maps etc. 
					It does not define how these elements should be presented. That´s why you need CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, 
					to define how you want your elements to be presented. In order to add style to your elements, you can apply 
					CSS rules to selected HTML elements. For example, you can add a certain type and size of fonts, a certain color,
					margins, space, or a background picture that is not part of the semantic content, but a purely presentational thing. 
				
					Most of the time it is best to write your CSS rules in a separate document. That 
					way, it is easy to maintain, and you can apply the same style to all your 
					HTML pages if you like. The following link was added to the HTML of 
					this page, at the end of the head element, in order to link it to the CSS file: <br/>
				&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/index.css"&gt;
				</p>
				
				<header>
					<h2>
						The Basic Structure and Syntax of CSS
					</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p> 
					To style your HTML elements, you first choose them with a CSS selector. For example, 
					the following CSS selects all the paragraps in a document, where no other rule is applied.<br> 
					<br>
					p{<br>
					}
				</p>
				<p>
					The script above will identify all elements on a certain level, for example all paragraphs. If you just want 
					to choose certain paragraphs, you will have to use a class selector. You could, for example, create a 
					classstyle called  .address, and apply it to all paragraphs consisting of an address.
				</p>
					
				<p>
				The following syntax identifies that have a certain attribute with a certain value - all input that has 
				the type text. This is very useful for presenting input in forms. 
					<br>
				<br>
					input[type="text"]{<br>
					}
				</p>
				<p>
					You can add properties to the chosen elements, like borders. The following will add 
					a bottom border, a line under all level 1 headlines: <br>
				<br>
					h1{<br>
					border-bottom: 2px white solid<br>
				}<br>
					If you only add a border, without specifictions, a frame around the headline 
					will be added.
				<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					The basic structure of HTML pages conssists of a root element that is marked by the 
					&lt;html&gt; tag. Inside that, there are two branches, the head and the body, which again have branches inside 
					them. When you choose to give a certain feature to a branch, everything inside that branch inherits the feature too. For example, 
					every table row is a child to the table body and inherits features from it, if you haven´t told it anything else.
					The table body, in turn, is a child of the table. You could use CSS selectors to choose specific children and 
					grandchildren, and give them features. 
					The following CSS chooses the HTML element and adds a background picture to it. <br>
				<br>
				html {<br>
					background-image: url("../images/Wood.jpg");<br>
					}
				</p>
				<p>
				The selector body &gt; p selects any paragraph element 
				that is a child of the body. For example, "details &gt; p" chooses every paragraph that is a child of a detail 
				element. The following syntax chooses every even row in a table and gives it an orange color.<br>
				<br>
				tr:nth-child(even){<br>
					background-color:orange;<br>
					}
				</p>
				
				<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> 	A CSS document concists of selectors, 
				each one followed by curly brackets. The selector chooses one or more elements in HTML that you want to apply 
				that style to, and then you define the style inside the brackets. The selectors can select tags, attributes, classes, 
				ID´s or certain children in the hierarchy.

                <h2>The measuring units in CSS</h2>
            </header>
			
			     <p>
				    CSS has many units for measuring. CSS has no particular restrictions, so you can normally choose freely which element 
				    you want to use. Some units are absolute, which means that they mean the same thing everywhere, inside and outside 
				    of CSS. Some are relative, which means they will be adapted to the context, for example depending on wheter you use 
				    a mobile phone for viewing them, a small laptop or a stationary computer. This explains why absolute units are not necessarily
				    very useful.
                </p>
            </section>
			
			<header>
                <h3>Absolute Units</h3>h3>
            </header>header>
			
			<p>
				An example of a unit is the pixel, px. This is basically a minimal point on the screen. CSS defines it as 
				1/96 of an inch in a printed version of the document. Other absolute measurement units are cm, mm, in, 
				which mean the same thing they would outside CSS - different length units. The unit pt stands for points 
				(1/72 of an inch), and pc for picas (1pc = 12 pt).
            </p>p>
			
			<header>
				<h3>Absolute Units</h3>
            </header>
			
			<p>
				An example of a relative unit is em, which is simply the font size. 
            </p>p>
			
			<p>
				A rarely used unit is ex, which means "relative to the current font´s x-height".
