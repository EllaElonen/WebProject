					<h1>The Box Model of CSS: Margins, borders,padding and other useful properties.</h1>
				</header>
        
				<p class="box"> 
					CSS is based on a box model, illustrated by this paragraph. The element itself, including the empty space 
					around it it called padding, is lightgreen, and around it there is a solid springgreen border. Te margins are 
					the space around the element and its borders. The top and bottom margins are wider, which is why there is 
					more space between this paragraph and the heading, and this and next paragraph. Around the borders of the element there´s a double, seagreen 
					outline. The difference between margins and padding is that margins define the space inside the borders of an element, 
					padding the space outside. 
				</P>
	
				<header>
					<h2>Margins</h2>
				</header>
		
				<p class="margin"> 
					Margins define the space outside the borders of an element, which means outside the colored area,
					if you have added background-color to your element. This paragraph has a margin of 70em. 
				</P>
				<p class="margins"> 
					This paragraph defines each margin separately; margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px; margin-right: 150px;
					margin-left: 80px;.
				</P>

					<h2>Borders</h2>
				</header>
		
				<p class="border-color">
					The border property has options to use border-color and other styles applied to the border. The border around 
					this paragraph has a solid style and a coral color applied to it. The style needs to be defined 
					before the color, otherwise te color has no effect. 
				</p>
	
				<p class="left">
					This paragraph has a border-left-color. 
				</p>
	
				<p class="right">
					This paragraph has a border-right-color. 
				</p>
	
				<p class="top">
					This paragraph has a order-top-color. 
				</p>
	
				<p class="bottom">
					This paragraph has a border-bottom-color. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="thin">
					The width of the borders can also be defined in it´s own property. This paragraph has a thin border-width.
				</p>
				
				<p class="thick">
					This paragraph has a thick border-width-bottom and 
					border-width-top, and a medium border-width-left and border-width-right.
				</p>

					<h2>Padding</h2>
				</header>
		
				<p class="padding"> 
					Padding is the space around the contents of an element, but still inside its borders (inside the colored area here). 
					For example, the headings on this page have a padding defined, 
					in order to make the colored area around it bigger, so the first letter does not start exactly at the border. 
					The padding of these headings is 20 px on the left (padding-left), and 10 px above and below (padding-top,padding-bottom).
					This paragraph has an increased padding, compared with other paragraphs (100 px). That shows up as 
					empty space inside the color frame. 
				</P>
				<p class="leftbottomtop">
					This paragraph has padding-left, padding-top, padding-bottom 120 and padding-right 0.
				</p>
				
				<p class="dotted">
					Elements can also have different outlines around them. This paragraph, for example, has a dotted outline, 
					and a solid border to illustrate the difference between border outline. The outline property also has 
					values dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset. 
				</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>				
				<h2 class="a">Visibility</h2>
				<h2 class="b">Heading with visibility hidden.</h2>
				
				<p>The above headings illustrate the property of visibility. The first one is set to visibility: visible. 
				What you do not see is another h2 "Heading with visibility: hidden". It still takes space 
				on the page, although you don´t see it.</p>
