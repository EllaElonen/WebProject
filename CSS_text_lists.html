		</header>
			<p>
				You can use the <span>font-family</span> property to specify the font in which you want the element to be presented.
				There are lots of fonts you can use in CSS, but all are not supported by all browsers. Otherwise, 
				it is possible to choose a preferred font, and a safe option to fall back on. For example, font-family: Arial, Times, sans-serif; 
				will give the browser Arial font-type to try, otherwise it will fall back on Times. 
				The following table presents some examples of fonts.
				
				There are three generic families of fonts: Serif, sans-serif, and monospace. Serifs are small end lines in some letters, 
				Monospace means fixed-width letters. that you can choose to have, or go without (sans-serif). Sans-serif might be 
				easier to read on a browser screen. 
			</P>

        <p>
			The font-size property defines the size of the fonts the chosen text will be presented in. The property "font-size-adjust"
			means that the font will be adjusted, in case the browser needs to go for the second choice of fonts. For example:   
			font-size-adjust: 0.58; (the aspect value of Verdana) is applied in the red text <span class="red">verdana that 
			might be replaced with times.</span>
        </p>    
		
		<p>
			The font-size can be set to <span class="medium">medium</span>, <span class ="xx-small">xx-small</span>, 
			<span class="x-small">medium</span>, <span class="small">small</span>
			<span="large">large</span>, <span="xx-large">xx-large</span>, <span="x-large">x-large</span>, 
			<span class="smaller">smaller</span> (than parent), or <span class="larger">larger</span> (than parent). 
			Other options are setting the length to a certain <span class="50%">percentage</span>, or relative length, for example  
			<span class="25em">25em</span>. It can be set to be inherited from a <span class="inherited">parent</span>
			or set back to <span class="initial"">initial</span>. 
		</p>
		
		<p> 
			The font style property can be set to <span class="italic">italic</span> or <span class="oblique">oblique</span>. 
			It can also be set to inherit the style from its parent, or that style can be set to initial. 
			For example, you an set the rest of a div element to italic, but a heading to itÂ´s original normal font-style. 
		</p> 
		
		<p>
			The font-variant property specifies if the text should be written in <span class="small-caps">small-caps</span> or normal. 
			Font-weight can be <span class="bold">bold</span>, normal or it can be set in numbers in the range 
			<span class="thinnest">100</span>-<span class="thickest">900</span>.
		</P>
		
		<p> 
			The <span class="letterspaced">letter spacing property</span> increases and decreases the space between characters. 
			<span class="wordspaced">Word spacing</span> does the same with the space between words.
			The line height property can change the <span class="height">line height</span> (the height of this line is 2). 
			
		<p>
			With the property text-decoration you can write <span class="underlined">underlined</span>, 
			<span class="overlined">overlined</span>, <span class="line-through">line-through</span> and 
			<span class="underlinedoverlined">underlined and overlined</span> text.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			With text-shadow you can add <span class="shadowed">shadows in different colors</span> to your text. 
		</P>
		
		<p class="indented">With text-indent, you can indent text in paragraphs as you like. </p>.
		
		<p class="left"> This paragraph is left-centered.</p>
		<p class="right"> This paragraph is right-centered.</p>
		<p class="centered"> This paragraph is centered.</p>
		<p class="justified"> This paragraph is justified.</p>
		
		<p>The property text-transformed can create text that is <span class="uppercase">uppercase</span>, 
		<span class="lowercase">lowercase</span> and <span class="capitalized">capitalized (initials)</span>.
		
		<p> With the white-space property you can change the handling of whitespaces in a text. Some examples:</P>
		
		<p class="no-wrap">no-wrap: This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
		This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. 
		This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.</P>
		
		<p class="normal">normal: This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
		This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. 
		This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.</P>

		This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. 
		This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.</P>
		
		<p class="firstline"> 
			The :first-line selector can be used to the the first line in a paragraph a different style. The style will not 
			be applied to the rest of the paragraph. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
			xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
			
		<p class="firstletter">You can also style the first letter of every paragraph</p>
		<p class="firstletter">with the :first-letter selector,</p>
		<p class="firstletter"> like what you see here.</p>
	
	<h2>Lists</h2>
	
	<p>
		This unordered list gets squares from a url with the help of the list-style property.
	</p>
	
        <ul class="ls">
            <li>Item</li>
            <li>Item</li>
            <li>Item</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The list-style property is actually shorthand for three other properties: list-style-image, 
			list-style-type and list style-position. The following list uses list-style-image to do the same as the list above. 
        </p>
